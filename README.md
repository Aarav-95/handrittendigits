# HandrittenDigits
Artificial Intelligence can seem demeaning sometimes, but in reality, it isn’t very complicated. Neural Networks are the basis of AI in which every “robot” you see on the internet, capable of making its own decisions, has at least one coded neural network inside of its program. The most prominent purpose of neural networks is Image Classifiers, capable of identifying patterns in images that it's presented to come up with a decision on their own. These classifiers seem like an incredible feat 10 years ago, but in this repository, you can see that creating one isn't as demeaning as you may think.

This Machine Learning algorithm can effectively and efficiently train the network to classify 28 x 28 pixel images of handwritten digits to their respective numbers to almost perfect accuracy.
